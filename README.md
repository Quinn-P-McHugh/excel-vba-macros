# Useful Excel VBA Macros

A repository of useful macros I've created for use in a variety of Excel VBA projects. 

Each macro is contained within its own text file and includes a multiline comment containing the name the macro, its purpose, what its arguments are, a place to write comments, and a section to note any revisions that have been made for project documentation purposes.

### Prerequisites

Microsoft Excel 2003 or later.
